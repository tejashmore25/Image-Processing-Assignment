## üìù Problems Solved

The Jupyter Notebook `DIP_Asignment_2.ipynb` addresses the following problems:

1.  **Question 1:** Perform Blur Operation then binarize the image, using required Box Filter.
2.  **Question 2:** (Geometric Operation) Analyse the difference between first Upsampling, then rotation of an image and first Rotation, then Upsampling of the same image.
3.  **Question 3:** (Unmash Sharpening) Using the Laplacian Filter, Perform Sharpening of the image.
