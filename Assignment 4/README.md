# Assignment 4

This folder contains my solution for Assignment 4 of the [**Digital Image Processing**](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~rajivs/#/teaching/dip) course. The primary goal of this assignment was to blur an image using custom Gaussian Filter and Restore the original image from the blurred image using the Inverse Filter of Gaussian.

## 📝 Problems Solved

The Jupyter Notebook `DIP_Assignment_4.ipynb` addresses the following problems:

1.  **Question 1:** (Image Downsampling) Effect of Downsampling on the image without using any Interpolation Technique and How Anti-Aliasing filter helps in proper downsampling of the image.
2.  **Question 2:** (Edge Detection) Analysis of different Edge detectors (Sobel and LOG) in detecting edges in both clean and noisy images, with and without Gaussian Smoothing.
