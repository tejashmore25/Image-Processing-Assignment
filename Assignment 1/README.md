## 📝 Problems Solved

The Jupyter Notebook `DIP_Asignment_1.ipynb` addresses the following problems:

1.  **Question 1:** Compute Histogram and analyse it.
2.  **Question 2:** (Otsu's Binarization) By minimizing the intra class variance and maximizing the inter class variance.
3.  **Question 3:** (Adaptive Binarization) Using the window of different sizes, binarize the image and then reconstruct the final binarized image.
4.  **Question 4:** (Connected Component) Extract the connected component and Manipulate the largest connected component.
