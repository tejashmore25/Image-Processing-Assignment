# Assignment 3

This folder contains my solution for Assignment 3 of the [**Digital Image Processing**](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~rajivs/#/teaching/dip) course. The primary goal of this assignment was to blur an image using custom Gaussian Filter and Restore the original image from the blurred image using the Inverse Filter of Gaussian.

## 📝 Problems Solved

The Jupyter Notebook `DIP_Asignment_3.ipynb` addresses the following problems:

1.  **Question 1:** (Directional Filter) Use Directional Filter to filter out frequencies which makes an angle with the straight axis from the center of the DFT
2.  **Question 2:** (Gaussian Blurring and Inverse Filtering) An image was blurred using the Gaussian Filter, then it was restored with the help of 2 kinds of kernel.
